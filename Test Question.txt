Coding challenge: Develop a simple Android/iOS app (with Java, Kotlin or Swift) that features a chat screen with preloaded data.

{
  "chat": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2018-05-28T10:00:00.000Z",
      "direction": "OUTGOING",
      "message": "Hello"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2018-05-29T11:05:00.000Z",
      "direction": "INCOMING",
      "message": "Hi"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2018-06-01T22:00:00.000Z",
      "direction": "OUTGOING",
      "message": "What is Mudah.my"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2018-06-02T22:01:00.000Z",
      "direction": "INCOMING",
      "message": "Mudah.my is the most favorite local app in Malaysia for searching, buying and selling pre-loved items. Get best deals at the reasonable prices from over 1,6 million items every day."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2018-06-03T09:15:00.000Z",
      "direction": "OUTGOING",
      "message": "I see, thanks!"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2018-06-04T08:50:00.000Z",
      "direction": "INCOMING",
      "message": "No problem!"
    }
  ]
}

1) You can use any libraries that you want but we expect that you craft your own XMLs for the UI part.

2) Hitting send should post a message to https://reqres.in/api/users

Example: POST: https://reqres.in/api/users
{ "message" : "Hello, world"}

You will get the following JSON response:
{
    "message": "Hello, world",
    "id": "287",
    "createdAt": "2018-06-30T13:08:04.623Z"
}

Once successful, append your typed message in the input field to the chat screen. 


3) Have the app message the user with a "Are you there?" message if the user has not sent anything in the last minute.

4) (Bonus) Include any sort of testing (Unit or UI testing)

We are really, really interested in your object oriented or functional design
skills, so please craft the most beautiful code you can.

Once you're done, please send us a standard zip of your source code. 
If you have problem to upload your work via email, kindly use google drive and share it back to us. 

*** Please do NOT make either your solution or this assignment publicly
available by, for example, using github or bitbucket or by posting this to a blog or forum.
